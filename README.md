# Objective
This project has the files of a proposed three-part algorithm to find a solution to a stochastic Simple Assembly Line Balancing (SALB-1) problem. In this case the SALB-1 problem is solve; thus, the number of open cells is unknown as well as the assignation of the task to the open cells.

The three parts are:
a) Solve the mixed--integer linear programming model using GLPK via Pyomo.
b) Create a SIMIO simulation model to add variability to the balancing using a set of parameter.
c) Optimise the value of the parameter by the SIMIO add-on OptQuest.

Open the corresponding file to open the files using to accomplish each part.
